How It's Made:

Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

First project playing around with Event Listeners in order to make changes to the DOM using JavaScript. I also learned what goes into making a hamburger menu that transforms. Had some fun with this one and hopefully can get back to it and make improvements.

Optimizations

Compress images 

Make responsive to mobile

Lessons Learned:

Learned quite a bit on all fronts on this one. Things broke and I figured out how to fix them while breaking other things along the way, but we made it!
