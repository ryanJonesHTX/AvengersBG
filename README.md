How It's Made:

Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

First project playing around with Event Listeners in order to make changes to the DOM using JavaScript. I also learned what goes into making a hamburger menu that transforms. Had some fun with this one and hopefully can get back to it and make improvements.

Optimizations

Compress images 

Make responsive to mobile

Lessons Learned:

No matter what your experience level, being an engineer means continuously learning. Every time you build something you always have those whoa this is awesome or fuck yeah I did it! moments. This is where you should share those moments! Recruiters and interviewers love to see that you're self-aware and passionate about growing.
